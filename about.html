    <p> I am an artist currently living in Miami with esperience from the Miami Institute of Art and Design looking for clientele interested in my artistic and business abilities. I have been creating art at a young age and once it was time to go to school
       started at MIU studying graphic design. It is my passion and pleasure to be able to work with many artists
       with similar views as well as being able to remain expressive. My ultimate goal would be to own my own gallery while 
       being a graphic designer here in Miami.
