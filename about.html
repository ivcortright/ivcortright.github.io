<title>About Me</title>
<p>My name is Isabel Cortright and I am a graphic design student at the Art Institute. I grew up in Miami and have been drawing and painting ever since I can remember. Some of my favorite artists include Salvador Dali and Jean-Michel Basquiat. In general, I enjoy all forms of art besides drawing and painting such as film, poetry, photography, etc. My dream is to one day own a gallery of my own. </p>
